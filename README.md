# CS50-PSet-8-Finance
This is my code for the C$50 Finance Flask application for Harvard's CS50 problems set 8.

Specifications:
Implement a web app via which user can manage portfolios of stocks. 
This tool should allow user to check real stocks’ actual prices and portfolios’ values. 
It also lets user "buy" and "sell" stocks by querying IEX for stocks’ prices.
